### **Features:**


#### Split Panes
```
Divide a tab up into multiple panes, each one showing a different session.
You can slice vertically and horizontally and create any number of panes in any arrangement.

Notice how inactive panes are slightly dimmed so it's easy to see which is active.

#### Search
```
iTerm2 comes with a robust find-on-page feature. The UI stays out of the way.
All matches are immediately highlighted. Even regular expression support is offered!

#### Autocomplete
```
Just type the start of any word that has ever appeared in your window and then Cmd-;
will pop open a window with suggestions. The word you're looking for is usually on top of the list!
